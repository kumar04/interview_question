Q.Write the code for a class which implements the Runnable interface?
     Public class  RunClass implement Runnable{
                    -------------
                   -------------
       public void run(){
             ---------
             }
        Runnable r=new RunClass();
        Thread thr=new Thread(r);
                    thr.start();
Q.There are m1(), m2() methods and t1,t2 threads. 
 How can t1 execute m1() and t2 executes m2()?
Q.What is “join()”? 
When a current thread wants to finish its complete execution and allow the second thread to do
its execution then first thread must invoke this join();
Q.)  What is InterruptedException?
       When two or more threads try to access same object simultaneously, then this exception  
         occurs.  Join(), wait(), notify() ,notifyAll() throws InterruptedException.
