                                                       method/variable.
       InterruptedException,---when two or more threads try to share same Resource(wait() and join()) 
	   NoSuchFieldException ---when we access the undeclared variable
	   NoSuchMethodException---when we invoke the undeclared method.
	   InstantiationException---when we try to create object for a abstract/interface

	   Unchecked Exceptions deal runtime errors.

       ArrayOutOfBoundsException,
       NullPointerException

Q. Difference between classNotFoundException and NoClassDefError in which situation we will face this?
ClassNotFoundException is an exception that occurs when you try to load a class at run time using Class.forName() or loadClass() methods and mentioned classes are not found in the classpath. NoClassDefFoundError is an error that occurs when a particular class is present at compile time, but was missing at run time
