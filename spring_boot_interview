Spring Boot increase Productivity.
When we talk about defaults, Spring Boot has its own opinions. If you are not specifying the details, it will use its own default configurations. If you want persistence, but donâ€™t specify anything else in your POM file, then Spring Boot configures Hibernate as a JPA provider with an HSQLDB database.
 To provide bunch of non-functional features/solutions that are very much common to large scale projects (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration).

Q3 How to monitor application in different environment?
Spring Boot Actuator is a sub-project of Spring Boot. It provides several production-grade services to your application out of the box. Once Actuator is configured in your Spring Boot application, you can interact and monitor your application by invoking different HTTP endpoints exposed by Spring Boot Actuator such as application health, bean details, version details, configurations, logger details, etc.

Q4 Why we are returning ResponseEntity from controller method why not direct object?


ResponseEntity is meant to represent the entire HTTP response. You can control anything that goes into it: status code, headers, and body.

@ResponseBody is a marker for the HTTP response body and @ResponseStatus declares the status code of the HTTP response.

@ResponseStatus isn't very flexible. It marks the entire method so you have to be sure that your handler method will always behave the same way. And you still can't set the headers. You'd need the HttpServletResponse or a HttpHeaders parameter.

Basically, ResponseEntity lets you do more.

When you associate an attribute batch job with a data model version, you can select the severity of the checks that will be returned as an error. When an error is returned, you must fix the error before the change will be committed to the feature or used by the template. If a warning is returned, the change will be committed, but it is recommended that you correct the issue if you can
